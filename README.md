A real-time event-oriented database

Inspired by the [cloudevents][cloudevents_io] of the `CNCF's` [serverless working group][serverless_wg], the event-driven computing system architecture has become the main governance solution and technological evolution direction of various cloud vendors and cloud native technology systems. To this end, we initiated the redcar project. The vision is to explore and improve cloud event standards together with cloud native. Our goal is to achieve a real-time event-oriented database that provides complete events such as event playback, exchange, replay, and persistence. Core drive capability.
