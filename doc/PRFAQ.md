## Press Release - Redcar

**Redcar: A real-time event-oriented data-hub**

On December 11, 2021, Redcar-io is pleased to announce that we have released 
a real-time event-oriented data-hub product. The goal is to help users achieve 
asynchronous capabilities between services. Hope to improve the energy efficiency 
of modern clouds through the event-driven service model.

Redcar uses gRPC to provide services, which is user-friendly and has low access 
costs (currently encapsulates `Rust` and `Go` clients). With high-performance **event 
exchange** capabilities, it provides point-to-point event awareness based on the 
traditional event-driven model. Provides transaction processing capabilities and 
data persistence capabilities for streaming events. It adopts a design architecture 
that is more in line with modern clouds.

Improving system performance is an eternal topic of continuous iteration and 
evolution in the technical field. Asynchronization has always been an important 
label of high-performance systems. Decoupling between services through message 
queues is the primary form of application asynchronization. In today's modern 
cloud scenario, the use of static messages to further improve the ability of 
application asynchronization reveals its shortcomings and deficiencies, which 
has become increasingly unable to meet the needs of users. "My system relies on 
a group of external inputs. I want to delegate this message to an intermediate 
system and notify me when there is an action trigger on the message, so that my 
attention can focus on the current business logic. Redcar has helped us do this 
well, and its performance is good enough to give us a lot in service asynchronous 
transformation and technology evolution surprise" said Miguel, head of infrastructure 
at Tick-io.
