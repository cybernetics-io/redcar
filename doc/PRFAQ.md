## Press Release - Redcar

**Redcar: A real-time event-oriented data-hub**

Improving system performance is an eternal topic of continuous iteration and evolution in the technical field. Asynchronization has always been an important label of high-performance systems. Decoupling between services through message queues is the primary form of application asynchronization. In today's modern cloud scenario, the use of static messages to further improve the ability of application asynchronization reveals its shortcomings and deficiencies, which has become increasingly unable to meet the needs of users. "My system relies on a group of external inputs. I want to delegate this message to an intermediate system and notify me when there is an action trigger on the message, so that my attention can focus on the current business logic. Redcar has helped us do this well, and its performance is good enough to give us a lot in service asynchronous transformation and technology evolution "Surprise," said Miguel, head of infrastructure at Tick-io.
