# A real-time event-oriented data-hub
In the past ten years, relying on the technical dividend of hardware performance
brought by Moore's law, we can focus on the construction of software products and
user experience, which has made great progress in software applications. A famous
CEO once said, why should we optimize the performance at the software level? Even
if we do nothing, the performance of our software will double every 18 months. With
the advent of the post Moore's law era, the performance improvement range of hardware
has gradually shrunk, and there is no longer the advantage of the past. Therefore, in
recent years, the infrastructure and programming tool chain represented by high-performance
software have attracted more and more attention, and this technological revolution will
bring us a new technical architecture upgrade and extreme performance experience, and our
product **Redcar is a connector from desktop to cloud and edge, The asynchronous collaboration
between functions on modern cloud is solved by event driven core model**.
